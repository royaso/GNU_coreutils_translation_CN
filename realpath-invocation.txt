18.5 realpath: Print the resolved file name.

realpath expands all symbolic links and resolves references to ‘/./’, ‘/../’
and extra ‘/’ characters. By default, all but the last component of the
specified files must exist. Synopsis:

realpath [option]… file…

The file name canonicalization functionality overlaps with that of the readlink
command. This is the preferred command for canonicalization as it’s a more
suitable and standard name. In addition this command supports relative file
name processing functionality.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-e’
‘--canonicalize-existing’
   
    Ensure that all components of the specified file names exist. If any
    component is missing or unavailable, realpath will output a diagnostic
    unless the -q option is specified, and exit with a nonzero exit code. A
    trailing slash requires that the name resolve to a directory.

‘-m’
‘--canonicalize-missing’
   
    If any component of a specified file name is missing or unavailable, treat
    it as a directory.

‘-L’
‘--logical’
   
    Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file names, but they are
    resolved after any subsequent ‘..’ components are processed.

‘-P’
‘--physical’
   
    Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file names, and they are
    resolved before any subsequent ‘..’ components are processed. This is the
    default mode of operation.

‘-q’
‘--quiet’
   
    Suppress diagnostic messages for specified file names.

‘--relative-to=dir’
   
    Print the resolved file names relative to the specified directory. Note
    this option honors the -m and -e options pertaining to file existence.

‘--relative-base=dir’
   
    Print the resolved file names as relative if the files are descendants of
    dir. Otherwise, print the resolved file names as absolute. Note this option
    honors the -m and -e options pertaining to file existence. For details
    about combining --relative-to and --relative-base, see Realpath usage
    examples.

‘-s’
‘--strip’
‘--no-symlinks’
   
    Do not resolve symbolic links. Only resolve references to ‘/./’, ‘/../’ and
    remove extra ‘/’ characters. When combined with the -m option, realpath
    operates only on the file name, and does not touch any actual file.

‘-z’
‘--zero’
   
    Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
    newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even when
    that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

Exit status:

0 if all file names were printed without issue.
1 otherwise.
