21.1.2 Date conversion specifiers

date conversion specifiers related to dates.

‘%a’

    locale’s abbreviated weekday name (e.g., ‘Sun’)

‘%A’

    locale’s full weekday name, variable length (e.g., ‘Sunday’)

‘%b’

    locale’s abbreviated month name (e.g., ‘Jan’)

‘%B’

    locale’s full month name, variable length (e.g., ‘January’)

‘%c’

    locale’s date and time (e.g., ‘Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005’)

‘%C’

    century. This is like ‘%Y’, except the last two digits are omitted. For
    example, it is ‘20’ if ‘%Y’ is ‘2000’, and is ‘-0’ if ‘%Y’ is ‘-001’. It is
    normally at least two characters, but it may be more.

‘%d’

    day of month (e.g., ‘01’)

‘%D’

    date; same as ‘%m/%d/%y’

‘%e’

    day of month, space padded; same as ‘%_d’

‘%F’

    full date in ISO 8601 format; same as ‘%Y-%m-%d’. This is a good choice for
    a date format, as it is standard and is easy to sort in the usual case
    where years are in the range 0000…9999.

‘%g’

    year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century (range
    ‘00’ through ‘99’). This has the same format and value as ‘%y’, except that
    if the ISO week number (see ‘%V’) belongs to the previous or next year,
    that year is used instead.

‘%G’

    year corresponding to the ISO week number. This has the same format and
    value as ‘%Y’, except that if the ISO week number (see ‘%V’) belongs to the
    previous or next year, that year is used instead. It is normally useful
    only if ‘%V’ is also used; for example, the format ‘%G-%m-%d’ is probably a
    mistake, since it combines the ISO week number year with the conventional
    month and day.

‘%h’

    same as ‘%b’

‘%j’

    day of year (‘001’…‘366’)

‘%m’

    month (‘01’…‘12’)

‘%q’

    quarter of year (‘1’…‘4’)

‘%u’

    day of week (‘1’…‘7’) with ‘1’ corresponding to Monday

‘%U’

    week number of year, with Sunday as the first day of the week (‘00’…‘53’).
    Days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are in week zero.

‘%V’

    ISO week number, that is, the week number of year, with Monday as the first
    day of the week (‘01’…‘53’). If the week containing January 1 has four or
    more days in the new year, then it is considered week 1; otherwise, it is
    week 53 of the previous year, and the next week is week 1. (See the ISO
    8601 standard.)

‘%w’

    day of week (‘0’…‘6’) with 0 corresponding to Sunday

‘%W’

    week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (‘00’…‘53’). Days in
    a new year preceding the first Monday are in week zero.

‘%x’

    locale’s date representation (e.g., ‘12/31/99’)

‘%y’

    last two digits of year (‘00’…‘99’)

‘%Y’

    year. This is normally at least four characters, but it may be more. Year
    ‘0000’ precedes year ‘0001’, and year ‘-001’ precedes year ‘0000’.
