6.6 sha1sum: Print or check SHA-1 digests

sha1sum computes a 160-bit checksum for each specified file. The usage and
options of this command are precisely the same as for md5sum. See md5sum
invocation.

Note: The SHA-1 digest is more reliable than a simple CRC (provided by the
cksum command) for detecting accidental file corruption, as the chances of
accidentally having two files with identical SHA-1 are vanishingly small.
However, it should not be considered secure against malicious tampering:
although finding a file with a given SHA-1 fingerprint is considered infeasible
at the moment, it is known how to modify certain files, including digital
certificates, so that they appear valid when signed with an SHA-1 digest. For
more secure hashes, consider using SHA-2, or the newer b2sum command. See sha2
utilities. See b2sum invocation.
