19.2 stty: Print or change terminal characteristics

stty prints or changes terminal characteristics, such as baud rate. Synopses:

stty [option] [setting]…
stty [option]

If given no line settings, stty prints the baud rate, line discipline number
(on systems that support it), and line settings that have been changed from the
values set by ‘stty sane’. By default, mode reading and setting are performed
on the tty line connected to standard input, although this can be modified by
the --file option.

stty accepts many non-option arguments that change aspects of the terminal line
operation, as described below.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-a’
‘--all’
   
    Print all current settings in human-readable form. This option may not be
    used in combination with any line settings.

‘-F device’
‘--file=device’
   
    Set the line opened by the file name specified in device instead of the tty
    line connected to standard input. This option is necessary because opening
    a POSIX tty requires use of the O_NONDELAY flag to prevent a POSIX tty from
    blocking until the carrier detect line is high if the clocal flag is not
    set. Hence, it is not always possible to allow the shell to open the device
    in the traditional manner.

‘-g’
‘--save’
   
    Print all current settings in a form that can be used as an argument to
    another stty command to restore the current settings. This option may not
    be used in combination with any line settings.

Many settings can be turned off by preceding them with a ‘-’. Such arguments
are marked below with “May be negated” in their description. The descriptions
themselves refer to the positive case, that is, when not negated (unless stated
otherwise, of course).

Some settings are not available on all POSIX systems, since they use
extensions. Such arguments are marked below with “Non-POSIX” in their
description. On non-POSIX systems, those or other settings also may not be
available, but it’s not feasible to document all the variations: just try it
and see.

stty is installed only on platforms with the POSIX terminal interface, so
portable scripts should not rely on its existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
