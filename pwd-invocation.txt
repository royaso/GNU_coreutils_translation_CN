19.1 pwd: Print working directory

pwd prints the name of the current directory. Synopsis:

pwd [option]…

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-L’
‘--logical’
   
    If the contents of the environment variable PWD provide an absolute name of
    the current directory with no ‘.’ or ‘..’ components, but possibly with
    symbolic links, then output those contents. Otherwise, fall back to default
    -P handling.

‘-P’
‘--physical’
   
    Print a fully resolved name for the current directory. That is, all
    components of the printed name will be actual directory names—none will be
    symbolic links.

If -L and -P are both given, the last one takes precedence. If neither option
is given, then this implementation uses -P as the default unless the
POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set.

Due to shell aliases and built-in pwd functions, using an unadorned pwd
interactively or in a script may get you different functionality than that
described here. Invoke it via env (i.e., env pwd …) to avoid interference from
the shell.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
