2.1 Exit status

Nearly every command invocation yields an integral exit status that can be used
to change how other commands work. For the vast majority of commands, an exit
status of zero indicates success. Failure is indicated by a nonzero
value—typically ‘1’, though it may differ on unusual platforms as POSIX
requires only that it be nonzero.

However, some of the programs documented here do produce other exit status
values and a few associate different meanings with the values ‘0’ and ‘1’. Here
are some of the exceptions: chroot, env, expr, nice, nohup, numfmt, printenv,
sort, stdbuf, test, timeout, tty.
