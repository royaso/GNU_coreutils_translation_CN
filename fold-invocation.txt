4.3 fold: Wrap input lines to fit in specified width

fold writes each file (- means standard input), or standard input if none are
given, to standard output, breaking long lines. Synopsis:

fold [option]… [file]…

By default, fold breaks lines wider than 80 columns. The output is split into
as many lines as necessary.

fold counts screen columns by default; thus, a tab may count more than one
column, backspace decreases the column count, and carriage return sets the
column to zero.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-b’
‘--bytes’
   
    Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and carriage
    returns are each counted as taking up one column, just like other
    characters.

‘-s’
‘--spaces’
   
    Break at word boundaries: the line is broken after the last blank before
    the maximum line length. If the line contains no such blanks, the line is
    broken at the maximum line length as usual.

‘-w width’
‘--width=width’
   
    Use a maximum line length of width columns instead of 80.

    For compatibility fold supports an obsolete option syntax -width. New
    scripts should use -w width instead.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
