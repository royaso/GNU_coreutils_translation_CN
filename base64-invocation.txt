3.6 base64: Transform data into printable data

base64 transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or from)
base64 encoded form. The base64 encoded form uses printable ASCII characters to
represent binary data. Synopses:

base64 [option]… [file]
base64 --decode [option]… [file]

The base64 encoding expands data to roughly 133% of the original. The base32
encoding expands data to roughly 160% of the original. The format conforms to
RFC 4648.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-w cols’
‘--wrap=cols’
   
    During encoding, wrap lines after cols characters. This must be a positive
    number.

    The default is to wrap after 76 characters. Use the value 0 to disable line
    wrapping altogether.

‘-d’
‘--decode’
   
    Change the mode of operation, from the default of encoding data, to
    decoding data. Input is expected to be base64 encoded data, and the output
    will be the original data.

‘-i’
‘--ignore-garbage’
   
    When decoding, newlines are always accepted. During decoding, ignore
    unrecognized bytes, to permit distorted data to be decoded.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
