12 Special file types

This chapter describes commands which create special types of files (and rmdir,
which removes directories, one special file type).

Although Unix-like operating systems have markedly fewer special file types
than others, not everything can be treated only as the undifferentiated byte
stream of normal files. For example, when a file is created or removed, the
system must record this information, which it does in a directory—a special
type of file. Although you can read directories as normal files, if you’re
curious, in order for the system to do its job it must impose a structure, a
certain order, on the bytes of the file. Thus it is a “special” type of file.

Besides directories, other special file types include named pipes (FIFOs),
symbolic links, sockets, and so-called special files.

• link invocation:        Make a hard link via the link syscall
• ln invocation:          Make links between files.
• mkdir invocation:       Make directories.
• mkfifo invocation:      Make FIFOs (named pipes).
• mknod invocation:       Make block or character special files.
• readlink invocation:    Print value of a symlink or canonical file name.
• rmdir invocation:       Remove empty directories.
• unlink invocation:      Remove files via the unlink syscall
