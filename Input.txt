19.2.2 Input settings

These settings control operations on data received from the terminal.

‘ignbrk’
   
    Ignore break characters. May be negated.

‘brkint’
   
    Make breaks cause an interrupt signal. May be negated.

‘ignpar’
   
    Ignore characters with parity errors. May be negated.

‘parmrk’
   
    Mark parity errors (with a 255-0-character sequence). May be negated.

‘inpck’
   
    Enable input parity checking. May be negated.

‘istrip’
   
    Clear high (8th) bit of input characters. May be negated.

‘inlcr’
   
    Translate newline to carriage return. May be negated.

‘igncr’
   
    Ignore carriage return. May be negated.

‘icrnl’
   
    Translate carriage return to newline. May be negated.

    Assume input characters are UTF-8 encoded. May be negated.

‘ixon’
   
    Enable XON/XOFF flow control (that is, Ctrl-S/Ctrl-Q). May be negated.

‘ixoff’
‘tandem’
   
    Enable sending of stop character when the system input buffer is almost
    full, and start character when it becomes almost empty again. May be
    negated.

‘iuclc’
   
    Translate uppercase characters to lowercase. Non-POSIX. May be negated.
    Note ilcuc is not implemented, as one would not be able to issue almost any
    (lowercase) Unix command, after invoking it.

‘ixany’
   
    Allow any character to restart output (only the start character if
    negated). Non-POSIX. May be negated.

‘imaxbel’
   
    Enable beeping and not flushing input buffer if a character arrives when
    the input buffer is full. Non-POSIX. May be negated.
