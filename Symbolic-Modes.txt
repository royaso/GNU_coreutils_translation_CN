27.2 Symbolic Modes

Symbolic modes represent changes to files’ mode bits as operations on
single-character symbols. They allow you to modify either all or selected parts
of files’ mode bits, optionally based on their previous values, and perhaps on
the current umask as well (see Umask and Protection).

The format of symbolic modes is:

[ugoa…][-+=]perms…[,…]

where perms is either zero or more letters from the set ‘rwxXst’, or a single
letter from the set ‘ugo’.

The following sections describe the operators and other details of symbolic
modes.

• Setting Permissions:           Basic operations on permissions.
• Copying Permissions:           Copying existing permissions.
• Changing Special Mode Bits:    Special mode bits.
• Conditional Executability:     Conditionally affecting executability.
• Multiple Changes:              Making multiple changes.
• Umask and Protection:          The effect of the umask.
