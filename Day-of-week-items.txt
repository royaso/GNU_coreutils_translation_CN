29.6 Day of week items

The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date (only if
necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

Days of the week may be spelled out in full: ‘Sunday’, ‘Monday’, ‘Tuesday’,
‘Wednesday’, ‘Thursday’, ‘Friday’ or ‘Saturday’. Days may be abbreviated to
their first three letters, optionally followed by a period. The special
abbreviations ‘Tues’ for ‘Tuesday’, ‘Wednes’ for ‘Wednesday’ and ‘Thur’ or
‘Thurs’ for ‘Thursday’ are also allowed.

A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward supplementary
weeks. It is best used in expression like ‘third monday’. In this context,
‘last day’ or ‘next day’ is also acceptable; they move one week before or after
the day that day by itself would represent.

A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.
