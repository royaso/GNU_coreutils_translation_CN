2.5 Signal specifications

A signal may be a signal name like ‘HUP’, or a signal number like ‘1’, or an
exit status of a process terminated by the signal. A signal name can be given
in canonical form or prefixed by ‘SIG’. The case of the letters is ignored. The
following signal names and numbers are supported on all POSIX compliant
systems:

‘HUP’

    1. Hangup.

‘INT’

    2. Terminal interrupt.

‘QUIT’

    3. Terminal quit.

‘ABRT’

    6. Process abort.

‘KILL’

    9. Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).

‘ALRM’

    14. Alarm Clock.

‘TERM’

    15. Termination.

Other supported signal names have system-dependent corresponding numbers. All
systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001 also support the following signals:

‘BUS’

    Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.

‘CHLD’

    Child process terminated, stopped, or continued.

‘CONT’

    Continue executing, if stopped.

‘FPE’

    Erroneous arithmetic operation.

‘ILL’

    Illegal Instruction.

‘PIPE’

    Write on a pipe with no one to read it.

‘SEGV’

    Invalid memory reference.

‘STOP’

    Stop executing (cannot be caught or ignored).

‘TSTP’

    Terminal stop.

‘TTIN’

    Background process attempting read.

‘TTOU’

    Background process attempting write.

‘URG’

    High bandwidth data is available at a socket.

‘USR1’

    User-defined signal 1.

‘USR2’

    User-defined signal 2.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XSI extension also support the
following signals:

‘POLL’

    Pollable event.

‘PROF’

    Profiling timer expired.

‘SYS’

    Bad system call.

‘TRAP’

    Trace/breakpoint trap.

‘VTALRM’

    Virtual timer expired.

‘XCPU’

    CPU time limit exceeded.

‘XFSZ’

    File size limit exceeded.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XRT extension also support at least
eight real-time signals called ‘RTMIN’, ‘RTMIN+1’, …, ‘RTMAX-1’, ‘RTMAX’.
