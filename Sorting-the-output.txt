10.1.3 Sorting the output

These options change the order in which ls sorts the information it outputs. By
default, sorting is done by character code (e.g., ASCII order).

‘-c’
‘--time=ctime’
‘--time=status’
   
    If the long listing format (e.g., -l, -o) is being used, print the status
    change timestamp (the ctime) instead of the mtime. When explicitly sorting
    by time (--sort=time or -t) or when not using a long listing format, sort
    according to the ctime. See File timestamps.

‘-f’
   
    Primarily, like -U—do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are
    stored in the directory. But also enable -a (list all files) and disable
    -l, --color, and -s (if they were specified before the -f).

‘-r’
‘--reverse’
   
    Reverse whatever the sorting method is—e.g., list files in reverse
    alphabetical order, youngest first, smallest first, or whatever.

‘-S’
‘--sort=size’
   
    Sort by file size, largest first.

‘-t’
‘--sort=time’
   
    Sort by modification timestamp (mtime), newest first. See File timestamps.

‘-u’
‘--time=atime’
‘--time=access’
‘--time=use’
   
    If the long listing format (e.g., --format=long) is being used, print the
    last access timestamp (the atime). When explicitly sorting by time (--sort=
    time or -t) or when not using a long listing format, sort according to the
    atime. See File timestamps.

‘-U’
‘--sort=none’
   
    Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in the
    directory. (Do not do any of the other unrelated things that -f does.) This
    is especially useful when listing very large directories, since not doing
    any sorting can be noticeably faster.

‘-v’
‘--sort=version’
   
    Sort by version name and number, lowest first. It behaves like a default
    sort, except that each sequence of decimal digits is treated numerically as
    an index/version number. (See Details about version sort.)

‘-X’
‘--sort=extension’
   
    Sort directory contents alphabetically by file extension (characters after
    the last ‘.’); files with no extension are sorted first.
