2 Common options

Certain options are available in all of these programs. Rather than writing
identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are described here. (In
fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept) these options.)

Normally options and operands can appear in any order, and programs act as if
all the options appear before any operands. For example, ‘sort -r passwd -t :’
acts like ‘sort -r -t : passwd’, since ‘:’ is an option-argument of -t.
However, if the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, options must
appear before operands, unless otherwise specified for a particular command.

A few programs can usefully have trailing operands with leading ‘-’. With such
a program, options must precede operands even if POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set,
and this fact is noted in the program description. For example, the env
command’s options must appear before its operands, since in some cases the
operands specify a command that itself contains options.

Most programs that accept long options recognize unambiguous abbreviations of
those options. For example, ‘rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty’ can be invoked
as ‘rmdir --ignore-fail’ or even ‘rmdir --i’. Ambiguous options, such as ‘ls
--h’, are identified as such.

Some of these programs recognize the --help and --version options only when one
of them is the sole command line argument. For these programs, abbreviations of
the long options are not always recognized.

‘--help’
   
    Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
    successfully.

‘--version’
   
    Print the version number, then exit successfully.

‘--’
   
    Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as operands
    even if they begin with ‘-’. For example, ‘sort -- -r’ reads from the file
    named -r.

A single ‘-’ operand is not really an option, though it looks like one. It
stands for a file operand, and some tools treat it as standard input, or as
standard output if that is clear from the context. For example, ‘sort -’ reads
from standard input, and is equivalent to plain ‘sort’. Unless otherwise
specified, a ‘-’ can appear as any operand that requires a file name.

• Exit status:                   Indicating program success or failure.
• Backup options:                -b -S, in some programs.
• Block size:                    BLOCK_SIZE and –block-size, in some programs.
• Floating point:                Floating point number representation.
• Signal specifications:         Specifying signals using the –signal option.
• Disambiguating names and       chgrp, chown, chroot, id: user and group
IDs:                             syntax
• Random sources:                –random-source, in some programs.
• Target directory:              Specifying a target directory, in some
                                 programs.
• Trailing slashes:              –strip-trailing-slashes, in some programs.
• Traversing symlinks:           -H, -L, or -P, in some programs.
• Treating / specially:          –preserve-root and –no-preserve-root.
• Special built-in utilities:    break, :, …
• Standards conformance:         Conformance to the POSIX standard.
• Multi-call invocation:         Multi-call program invocation.
