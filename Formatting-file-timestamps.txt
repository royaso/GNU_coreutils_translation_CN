10.1.6 Formatting file timestamps

By default, file timestamps are listed in abbreviated form, using a date like
‘Mar 30  2002’ for non-recent timestamps, and a date-without-year and time like
‘Mar 30 23:45’ for recent timestamps. This format can change depending on the
current locale as detailed below.

A timestamp is considered to be recent if it is less than six months old, and
is not dated in the future. If a timestamp dated today is not listed in recent
form, the timestamp is in the future, which means you probably have clock skew
problems which may break programs like make that rely on file timestamps. See
File timestamps.

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the TZ
environment variable, or by the system default rules if TZ is not set. See
Specifying the Time Zone with TZ in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

The following option changes how file timestamps are printed.

‘--time-style=style’
   
    List timestamps in style style. The style should be one of the following:

    ‘+format’
       
        List timestamps using format, where format is interpreted like the
        format argument of date (see date invocation). For example,
        --time-style="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" causes ls to list timestamps like
        ‘2002-03-30 23:45:56’. As with date, format’s interpretation is
        affected by the LC_TIME locale category.

        If format contains two format strings separated by a newline, the
        former is used for non-recent files and the latter for recent files; if
        you want output columns to line up, you may need to insert spaces in
        one of the two formats.

    ‘full-iso’

        List timestamps in full using ISO 8601-like date, time, and time zone
        components with nanosecond precision, e.g., ‘2002-03-30
        23:45:56.477817180 -0700’. This style is equivalent to ‘+%Y-%m-%d
        %H:%M:%S.%N %z’.

        This is useful because the time output includes all the information
        that is available from the operating system. For example, this can help
        explain make’s behavior, since GNU make uses the full timestamp to
        determine whether a file is out of date.

    ‘long-iso’

        List ISO 8601 date and time components with minute precision, e.g.,
        ‘2002-03-30 23:45’. These timestamps are shorter than ‘full-iso’
        timestamps, and are usually good enough for everyday work. This style
        is equivalent to ‘+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M’.

    ‘iso’

        List ISO 8601 dates for non-recent timestamps (e.g., ‘2002-03-30 ’),
        and ISO 8601-like month, day, hour, and minute for recent timestamps
        (e.g., ‘03-30 23:45’). These timestamps are uglier than ‘long-iso’
        timestamps, but they carry nearly the same information in a smaller
        space and their brevity helps ls output fit within traditional
        80-column output lines. The following two ls invocations are
        equivalent:

        newline='
        '
        ls -l --time-style="+%Y-%m-%d $newline%m-%d %H:%M"
        ls -l --time-style="iso"

    ‘locale’
       
        List timestamps in a locale-dependent form. For example, a Finnish
        locale might list non-recent timestamps like ‘maalis 30  2002’ and
        recent timestamps like ‘maalis 30 23:45’. Locale-dependent timestamps
        typically consume more space than ‘iso’ timestamps and are harder for
        programs to parse because locale conventions vary so widely, but they
        are easier for many people to read.

        The LC_TIME locale category specifies the timestamp format. The default
        POSIX locale uses timestamps like ‘Mar 30  2002’ and ‘Mar 30 23:45’; in
        this locale, the following two ls invocations are equivalent:

        newline='
        '
        ls -l --time-style="+%b %e  %Y$newline%b %e %H:%M"
        ls -l --time-style="locale"

        Other locales behave differently. For example, in a German locale,
        --time-style="locale" might be equivalent to --time-style="+%e. %b %Y
        $newline%e. %b %H:%M" and might generate timestamps like ‘30. Mär
        2002 ’ and ‘30. Mär 23:45’.

    ‘posix-style’
       
        List POSIX-locale timestamps if the LC_TIME locale category is POSIX,
        style timestamps otherwise. For example, the ‘posix-long-iso’ style
        lists timestamps like ‘Mar 30  2002’ and ‘Mar 30 23:45’ when in the
        POSIX locale, and like ‘2002-03-30 23:45’ otherwise.

You can specify the default value of the --time-style option with the
environment variable TIME_STYLE; if TIME_STYLE is not set the default style is
‘locale’. GNU Emacs 21.3 and later use the --dired option and therefore can
parse any date format, but if you are using Emacs 21.1 or 21.2 and specify a
non-POSIX locale you may need to set ‘TIME_STYLE="posix-long-iso"’.

To avoid certain denial-of-service attacks, timestamps that would be longer
than 1000 bytes may be treated as errors.
