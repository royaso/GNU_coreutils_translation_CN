29.11 Authors of parse_datetime

parse_datetime started life as getdate, as originally implemented by Steven M.
Bellovin (smb@research.att.com) while at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. The code was later tweaked by a couple of people on Usenet, then
completely overhauled by Rich $alz (rsalz@bbn.com) and Jim Berets (
jberets@bbn.com) in August, 1990. Various revisions for the GNU system were
made by David MacKenzie, Jim Meyering, Paul Eggert and others, including
renaming it to get_date to avoid a conflict with the alternative Posix function
getdate, and a later rename to parse_datetime. The Posix function getdate can
parse more locale-specific dates using strptime, but relies on an environment
variable and external file, and lacks the thread-safety of parse_datetime.

This chapter was originally produced by François Pinard (
pinard@iro.umontreal.ca) from the parse_datetime.y source code, and then edited
by K. Berry (kb@cs.umb.edu).
