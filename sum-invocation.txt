6.2 sum: Print checksum and block counts

sum computes a 16-bit checksum for each given file, or standard input if none
are given or for a file of ‘-’. Synopsis:

sum [option]… [file]…

sum prints the checksum for each file followed by the number of blocks in the
file (rounded up). If more than one file is given, file names are also printed
(by default). (With the --sysv option, corresponding file names are printed
when there is at least one file argument.)

By default, GNU sum computes checksums using an algorithm compatible with BSD
sum and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-r’
   
    Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm. This option is included for
    compatibility with the System V sum. Unless -s was also given, it has no
    effect.

‘-s’
‘--sysv’
   
    Compute checksums using an algorithm compatible with System V sum’s
    default, and print file sizes in units of 512-byte blocks.

sum is provided for compatibility; the cksum program (see next section) is
preferable in new applications.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
