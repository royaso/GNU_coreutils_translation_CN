21.2 arch: Print machine hardware name

arch prints the machine hardware name, and is equivalent to ‘uname -m’.
Synopsis:

arch [option]

The program accepts the Common options only.

arch is not installed by default, so portable scripts should not rely on its
existence.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
