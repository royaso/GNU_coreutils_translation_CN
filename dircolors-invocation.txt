10.4 dircolors: Color setup for ls

dircolors outputs a sequence of shell commands to set up the terminal for color
output from ls (and dir, etc.). Typical usage:

eval "$(dircolors [option]… [file])"

If file is specified, dircolors reads it to determine which colors to use for
which file types and extensions. Otherwise, a precompiled database is used. For
details on the format of these files, run ‘dircolors --print-database’.

To make dircolors read a ~/.dircolors file if it exists, you can put the
following lines in your ~/.bashrc (or adapt them to your favorite shell):

d=.dircolors
test -r $d && eval "$(dircolors $d)"

The output is a shell command to set the LS_COLORS environment variable. You
can specify the shell syntax to use on the command line, or dircolors will
guess it from the value of the SHELL environment variable.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-b’
‘--sh’
‘--bourne-shell’
   
    Output Bourne shell commands. This is the default if the SHELL environment
    variable is set and does not end with ‘csh’ or ‘tcsh’.

‘-c’
‘--csh’
‘--c-shell’
   
    Output C shell commands. This is the default if SHELL ends with csh or
    tcsh.

‘-p’
‘--print-database’
   
    Print the (compiled-in) default color configuration database. This output
    is itself a valid configuration file, and is fairly descriptive of the
    possibilities.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
