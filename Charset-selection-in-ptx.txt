7.5.2 Charset selection

As it is set up now, the program assumes that the input file is coded using
8-bit ISO 8859-1 code, also known as Latin-1 character set, unless it is
compiled for MS-DOS, in which case it uses the character set of the IBM-PC.
(GNU ptx is not known to work on smaller MS-DOS machines anymore.) Compared to
7-bit ASCII, the set of characters which are letters is different; this alters
the behavior of regular expression matching. Thus, the default regular
expression for a keyword allows foreign or diacriticized letters. Keyword
sorting, however, is still crude; it obeys the underlying character set
ordering quite blindly.

‘-f’
‘--ignore-case’
   
    Fold lower case letters to upper case for sorting.
