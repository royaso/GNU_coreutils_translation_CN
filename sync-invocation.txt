14.4 sync: Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

sync synchronizes in memory files or file systems to persistent storage.
Synopsis:

sync [option] [file]…

sync writes any data buffered in memory out to disk. This can include (but is
not limited to) modified superblocks, modified inodes, and delayed reads and
writes. This must be implemented by the kernel; The sync program does nothing
but exercise the sync, syncfs, fsync, and fdatasync system calls.

The kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow) disk reads and
writes. This improves performance, but if the computer crashes, data may be
lost or the file system corrupted as a result. The sync command instructs the
kernel to write data in memory to persistent storage.

If any argument is specified then only those files will be synchronized using
the fsync(2) syscall by default.

If at least one file is specified, it is possible to change the synchronization
method with the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-d’
‘--data’
   
    Use fdatasync(2) to sync only the data for the file, and any metadata
    required to maintain file system consistency.

‘-f’
‘--file-system’
   
    Synchronize all the I/O waiting for the file systems that contain the file,
    using the syscall syncfs(2). Note you would usually not specify this option
    if passing a device node like ‘/dev/sda’ for example, as that would sync
    the containing file system rather than the referenced one. Note also that
    depending on the system, passing individual device nodes or files may have
    different sync characteristics than using no arguments. I.e., arguments
    passed to fsync(2) may provide greater guarantees through write barriers,
    than a global sync(2) used when no arguments are provided.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
