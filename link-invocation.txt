12.1 link: Make a hard link via the link syscall

link creates a single hard link at a time. It is a minimalist interface to the
system-provided link function. See Hard Links in The GNU C Library Reference
Manual. It avoids the bells and whistles of the more commonly-used ln command
(see ln invocation). Synopsis:

link filename linkname

filename must specify an existing file, and linkname must specify a nonexistent
entry in an existing directory. link simply calls link (filename, linkname) to
create the link.

On a GNU system, this command acts like ‘ln --directory --no-target-directory
filename linkname’. However, the --directory and --no-target-directory options
are not specified by POSIX, and the link command is more portable in practice.

If filename is a symbolic link, it is unspecified whether linkname will be a
hard link to the symbolic link or to the target of the symbolic link. Use ln -P
or ln -L to specify which behavior is desired.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
