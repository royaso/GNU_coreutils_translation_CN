2.13 Standards conformance

In a few cases, the GNU utilities’ default behavior is incompatible with the
POSIX standard. To suppress these incompatibilities, define the POSIXLY_CORRECT
environment variable. Unless you are checking for POSIX conformance, you
probably do not need to define POSIXLY_CORRECT.

Newer versions of POSIX are occasionally incompatible with older versions. For
example, older versions of POSIX required the command ‘sort +1’ to sort based
on the second and succeeding fields in each input line, but in POSIX
1003.1-2001 the same command is required to sort the file named +1, and you
must instead use the command ‘sort -k 2’ to get the field-based sort. To
complicate things further, POSIX 1003.1-2008 allows an implementation to have
either the old or the new behavior.

The GNU utilities normally conform to the version of POSIX that is standard for
your system. To cause them to conform to a different version of POSIX, define
the _POSIX2_VERSION environment variable to a value of the form yyyymm
specifying the year and month the standard was adopted. Three values are
currently supported for _POSIX2_VERSION: ‘199209’ stands for POSIX 1003.2-1992,
‘200112’ stands for POSIX 1003.1-2001, and ‘200809’ stands for POSIX
1003.1-2008. For example, if you have a POSIX 1003.1-2001 system but are
running software containing traditional usage like ‘sort +1’ or ‘tail +10’, you
can work around the compatibility problems by setting ‘_POSIX2_VERSION=200809’
in your environment.
