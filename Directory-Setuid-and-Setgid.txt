27.5 Directories and the Set-User-ID and Set-Group-ID Bits

On most systems, if a directory’s set-group-ID bit is set, newly created
subfiles inherit the same group as the directory, and newly created
subdirectories inherit the set-group-ID bit of the parent directory. On a few
systems, a directory’s set-user-ID bit has a similar effect on the ownership of
new subfiles and the set-user-ID bits of new subdirectories. These mechanisms
let users share files more easily, by lessening the need to use chmod or chown
to share new files.

These convenience mechanisms rely on the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of
directories. If commands like chmod and mkdir routinely cleared these bits on
directories, the mechanisms would be less convenient and it would be harder to
share files. Therefore, a command like chmod does not affect the set-user-ID or
set-group-ID bits of a directory unless the user specifically mentions them in
a symbolic mode, or uses an operator numeric mode such as ‘=755’, or sets them
in a numeric mode, or clears them in a numeric mode that has five or more octal
digits. For example, on systems that support set-group-ID inheritance:

# These commands leave the set-user-ID and
# set-group-ID bits of the subdirectories alone,
# so that they retain their default values.
mkdir A B C
chmod 755 A
chmod 0755 B
chmod u=rwx,go=rx C
mkdir -m 755 D
mkdir -m 0755 E
mkdir -m u=rwx,go=rx F

If you want to try to set these bits, you must mention them explicitly in the
symbolic or numeric modes, e.g.:

# These commands try to set the set-user-ID
# and set-group-ID bits of the subdirectories.
mkdir G
chmod 6755 G
chmod +6000 G
chmod u=rwx,go=rx,a+s G
mkdir -m 6755 H
mkdir -m +6000 I
mkdir -m u=rwx,go=rx,a+s J

If you want to try to clear these bits, you must mention them explicitly in a
symbolic mode, or use an operator numeric mode, or specify a numeric mode with
five or more octal digits, e.g.:

# These commands try to clear the set-user-ID
# and set-group-ID bits of the directory D.
chmod a-s D
chmod -6000 D
chmod =755 D
chmod 00755 D

This behavior is a GNU extension. Portable scripts should not rely on requests
to set or clear these bits on directories, as POSIX allows implementations to
ignore these requests. The GNU behavior with numeric modes of four or fewer
digits is intended for scripts portable to systems that preserve these bits;
the behavior with numeric modes of five or more digits is for scripts portable
to systems that do not preserve the bits.
