29.2 Calendar date items

A calendar date item specifies a day of the year. It is specified differently,
depending on whether the month is specified numerically or literally. All these
strings specify the same calendar date:

1972-09-24     # ISO 8601.
72-9-24        # Assume 19xx for 69 through 99,
               # 20xx for 00 through 68.
72-09-24       # Leading zeros are ignored.
9/24/72        # Common U.S. writing.
24 September 1972
24 Sept 72     # September has a special abbreviation.
24 Sep 72      # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
Sep 24, 1972
24-sep-72
24sep72

The year can also be omitted. In this case, the last specified year is used, or
the current year if none. For example:

9/24
sep 24

Here are the rules.

For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format ‘year-month-day’ is allowed, where year
is any positive number, month is a number between 01 and 12, and day is a
number between 01 and 31. A leading zero must be present if a number is less
than ten. If year is 68 or smaller, then 2000 is added to it; otherwise, if
year is less than 100, then 1900 is added to it. The construct ‘month/day/
year’, popular in the United States, is accepted. Also ‘month/day’, omitting
the year.

Literal months may be spelled out in full: ‘January’, ‘February’, ‘March’,
‘April’, ‘May’, ‘June’, ‘July’, ‘August’, ‘September’, ‘October’, ‘November’ or
‘December’. Literal months may be abbreviated to their first three letters,
possibly followed by an abbreviating dot. It is also permitted to write ‘Sept’
instead of ‘September’.

When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as any of the
following:

day month year
day month
month day year
day-month-year

Or, omitting the year:

month day
