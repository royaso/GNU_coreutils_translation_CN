11.3 install: Copy files and set attributes

install copies files while setting their file mode bits and, if possible, their
owner and group. Synopses:

install [option]… [-T] source dest
install [option]… source… directory
install [option]… -t directory source…
install [option]… -d directory…

  • If two file names are given, install copies the first file to the second.
  • If the --target-directory (-t) option is given, or failing that if the last
    file is a directory and the --no-target-directory (-T) option is not given,
    install copies each source file to the specified directory, using the
    sources’ names.
  • If the --directory (-d) option is given, install creates each directory and
    any missing parent directories. Parent directories are created with mode ‘u
    =rwx,go=rx’ (755), regardless of the -m option or the current umask. See
    Directory Setuid and Setgid, for how the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits
    of parent directories are inherited.

install is similar to cp, but allows you to control the attributes of
destination files. It is typically used in Makefiles to copy programs into
their destination directories. It refuses to copy files onto themselves.

install never preserves extended attributes (xattr).

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-b’
‘--backup[=method]’
   
    See Backup options. Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be
    overwritten or removed.

‘-C’
‘--compare’
   
    Compare each pair of source and destination files, and if the destination
    has identical content and any specified owner, group, permissions, and
    possibly SELinux context, then do not modify the destination at all. Note
    this option is best used in conjunction with --user, --group and --mode
    options, lest install incorrectly determines the default attributes that
    installed files would have (as it doesn’t consider setgid directories and
    POSIX default ACLs for example). This could result in redundant copies or
    attributes that are not reset to the correct defaults.

‘-c’
   
    Ignored; for compatibility with old Unix versions of install.

‘-D’
   
    Create any missing parent directories of dest, then copy source to dest.
    Explicitly specifying the --target-directory=dir will similarly ensure the
    presence of that hierarchy before copying source arguments.

‘-d’
‘--directory’
   
    Create any missing parent directories, giving them the default attributes.
    Then create each given directory, setting their owner, group and mode as
    given on the command line or to the defaults.

‘-g group’
‘--group=group’
   
    Set the group ownership of installed files or directories to group. The
    default is the process’s current group. group may be either a group name or
    a numeric group ID.

‘-m mode’
‘--mode=mode’
   
    Set the file mode bits for the installed file or directory to mode, which
    can be either an octal number, or a symbolic mode as in chmod, with ‘a=’
    (no access allowed to anyone) as the point of departure (see File
    permissions). The default mode is ‘u=rwx,go=rx,a-s’—read, write, and
    execute for the owner, read and execute for group and other, and with
    set-user-ID and set-group-ID disabled. This default is not quite the same
    as ‘755’, since it disables instead of preserving set-user-ID and
    set-group-ID on directories. See Directory Setuid and Setgid.

‘-o owner’
‘--owner=owner’
   
    If install has appropriate privileges (is run as root), set the ownership
    of installed files or directories to owner. The default is root. owner may
    be either a user name or a numeric user ID.

‘--preserve-context’
   
    Preserve the SELinux security context of files and directories. Failure to
    preserve the context in all of the files or directories will result in an
    exit status of 1. If SELinux is disabled then print a warning and ignore
    the option.

‘-p’
‘--preserve-timestamps’
   
    Set the time of last access and the time of last modification of each
    installed file to match those of each corresponding original file. When a
    file is installed without this option, its last access and last
    modification timestamps are both set to the time of installation. This
    option is useful if you want to use the last modification timestamps of
    installed files to keep track of when they were last built as opposed to
    when they were last installed.

‘-s’
‘--strip’
   
    Strip the symbol tables from installed binary executables.

‘--strip-program=program’
   
    Program used to strip binaries.

‘-S suffix’
‘--suffix=suffix’
   
    Append suffix to each backup file made with -b. See Backup options.

‘-t directory’
‘--target-directory=directory’
   
    Specify the destination directory. See Target directory. Also specifying
    the -D option will ensure the directory is present.

‘-T’
‘--no-target-directory’
   
    Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
    symbolic link to a directory. See Target directory.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
   
    Print the name of each file before copying it.

‘-Z’
‘--context[=context]’
   
    Without a specified context, adjust the SELinux security context according
    to the system default type for destination files, similarly to the
    restorecon command. The long form of this option with a specific context
    specified, will set the context for newly created files only. With a
    specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a warning is
    issued. This option is mutually exclusive with the --preserve-context
    option.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
