12.4 mkfifo: Make FIFOs (named pipes)

mkfifo creates FIFOs (also called named pipes) with the specified names.
Synopsis:

mkfifo [option] name…

A FIFO is a special file type that permits independent processes to
communicate. One process opens the FIFO file for writing, and another for
reading, after which data can flow as with the usual anonymous pipe in shells
or elsewhere.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-m mode’
‘--mode=mode’
   
    Set the mode of created FIFOs to mode, which is symbolic as in chmod and
    uses ‘a=rw’ (read and write allowed for everyone) for the point of
    departure. mode should specify only file permission bits. See File
    permissions.

‘-Z’
‘--context[=context]’
   
    Without a specified context, adjust the SELinux security context according
    to the system default type for destination files, similarly to the
    restorecon command. The long form of this option with a specific context
    specified, will set the context for newly created files only. With a
    specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a warning is
    issued.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
