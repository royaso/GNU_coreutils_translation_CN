2.2 Backup options

Some GNU programs (at least cp, install, ln, and mv) optionally make backups of
files before writing new versions. These options control the details of these
backups. The options are also briefly mentioned in the descriptions of the
particular programs.

‘-b’
‘--backup[=method]’
   
    Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or removed.
    Without this option, the original versions are destroyed. Use method to
    determine the type of backups to make. When this option is used but method
    is not specified, then the value of the VERSION_CONTROL environment
    variable is used. And if VERSION_CONTROL is not set, the default backup
    type is ‘existing’.

    Note that the short form of this option, -b does not accept any argument.
    Using -b is equivalent to using --backup=existing.

    This option corresponds to the Emacs variable ‘version-control’; the values
    for method are the same as those used in Emacs. This option also accepts
    more descriptive names. The valid methods are (unique abbreviations are
    accepted):

    ‘none’
    ‘off’
       
        Never make backups.

    ‘numbered’
    ‘t’

        Always make numbered backups.

    ‘existing’
    ‘nil’
       
        Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple backups
        of the others.

    ‘simple’
    ‘never’
       
        Always make simple backups. Please note ‘never’ is not to be confused
        with ‘none’.

‘-S suffix’
‘--suffix=suffix’
   
    Append suffix to each backup file made with -b. If this option is not
    specified, the value of the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable is
    used. And if SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX is not set, the default is ‘~’, just as
    in Emacs.
