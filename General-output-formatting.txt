10.1.5 General output formatting

These options affect the appearance of the overall output.

‘-1’
‘--format=single-column’
   
    List one file per line. This is the default for ls when standard output is
    not a terminal. See also the -b and -q options to suppress direct output of
    newline characters within a file name.

‘-C’
‘--format=vertical’
   
    List files in columns, sorted vertically. This is the default for ls if
    standard output is a terminal. It is always the default for the dir
    program. GNU ls uses variable width columns to display as many files as
    possible in the fewest lines.

‘--color [=when]’
   
    Specify whether to use color for distinguishing file types. when may be
    omitted, or one of:

      □ none - Do not use color at all. This is the default.
      □ auto - Only use color if standard output is a terminal.
      □ always - Always use color.

    Specifying --color and no when is equivalent to --color=always. If piping a
    colorized listing through a pager like less, use the -R option to pass the
    color codes to the terminal.

    Note that using the --color option may incur a noticeable performance
    penalty when run in a directory with very many entries, because the default
    settings require that ls stat every single file it lists. However, if you
    would like most of the file-type coloring but can live without the other
    coloring options (e.g., executable, orphan, sticky, other-writable,
    capability), use dircolors to set the LS_COLORS environment variable like
    this,

    eval $(dircolors -p | perl -pe \
      's/^((CAP|S[ET]|O[TR]|M|E)\w+).*/$1 00/' | dircolors -)

    and on a dirent.d_type-capable file system, ls will perform only one stat
    call per command line argument.

‘-F’
‘--classify’
‘--indicator-style=classify’
   
    Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. Also, for
    regular files that are executable, append ‘*’. The file type indicators are
    ‘/’ for directories, ‘@’ for symbolic links, ‘|’ for FIFOs, ‘=’ for
    sockets, ‘>’ for doors, and nothing for regular files. Do not follow
    symbolic links listed on the command line unless the
    --dereference-command-line (-H), --dereference (-L), or
    --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir options are specified.

‘--file-type’
‘--indicator-style=file-type’
   
    Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. This is like
    -F, except that executables are not marked.

‘--hyperlink [=when]’
   
    Output codes recognized by some terminals to link to files using the ‘file:
    //’ URI format. when may be omitted, or one of:

      □ none - Do not use hyperlinks at all. This is the default.
      □ auto - Only use hyperlinks if standard output is a terminal.
      □ always - Always use hyperlinks.

    Specifying --hyperlink and no when is equivalent to --hyperlink=always.

‘--indicator-style=word’
   
    Append a character indicator with style word to entry names, as follows:

    ‘none’

        Do not append any character indicator; this is the default.

    ‘slash’

        Append ‘/’ for directories. This is the same as the -p option.

    ‘file-type’

        Append ‘/’ for directories, ‘@’ for symbolic links, ‘|’ for FIFOs, ‘=’
        for sockets, and nothing for regular files. This is the same as the
        --file-type option.

    ‘classify’

        Append ‘*’ for executable regular files, otherwise behave as for
        ‘file-type’. This is the same as the -F or --classify option.

‘-k’
‘--kibibytes’
   
    Set the default block size to its normal value of 1024 bytes, overriding
    any contrary specification in environment variables (see Block size). This
    option is in turn overridden by the --block-size, -h or --human-readable,
    and --si options.

    The -k or --kibibytes option affects the per-directory block count written
    by the -l and similar options, and the size written by the -s or --size
    option. It does not affect the file size written by -l.

‘-m’
‘--format=commas’
   
    List files horizontally, with as many as will fit on each line, separated
    by ‘, ’ (a comma and a space).

‘-p’
‘--indicator-style=slash’
   
    Append a ‘/’ to directory names.

‘-x’
‘--format=across’
‘--format=horizontal’
   
    List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

‘-T cols’
‘--tabsize=cols’
   
    Assume that each tab stop is cols columns wide. The default is 8. ls uses
    tabs where possible in the output, for efficiency. If cols is zero, do not
    use tabs at all.

    Some terminal emulators might not properly align columns to the right of a
    TAB following a non-ASCII byte. You can avoid that issue by using the -T0
    option or put TABSIZE=0 in your environment, to tell ls to align using
    spaces, not tabs.

‘-w cols’
‘--width=cols’
   
    Assume the screen is cols columns wide. The default is taken from the
    terminal settings if possible; otherwise the environment variable COLUMNS
    is used if it is set; otherwise the default is 80. With a cols value of
    ‘0’, there is no limit on the length of the output line, and that single
    output line will be delimited with spaces, not tabs.
