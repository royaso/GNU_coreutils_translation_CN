23.1 chroot: Run a command with a different root directory

chroot runs a command with a specified root directory. On many systems, only
the super-user can do this.^5. Synopses:

chroot option newroot [command [args]…]
chroot option

Ordinarily, file names are looked up starting at the root of the directory
structure, i.e., /. chroot changes the root to the directory newroot (which
must exist), then changes the working directory to /, and finally runs command
with optional args. If command is not specified, the default is the value of
the SHELL environment variable or /bin/sh if not set, invoked with the -i
option. command must not be a special built-in utility (see Special built-in
utilities).

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options. Options
must precede operands.

‘--groups=groups’
   
    Use this option to override the supplementary groups to be used by the new
    process. The items in the list (names or numeric IDs) must be separated by
    commas. Use ‘--groups=''’ to disable the supplementary group look-up
    implicit in the --userspec option.

‘--userspec=user[:group]’
   
    By default, command is run with the same credentials as the invoking
    process. Use this option to run it as a different user and/or with a
    different primary group. If a user is specified then the supplementary
    groups are set according to the system defined list for that user, unless
    overridden with the --groups option.

‘--skip-chdir’
   
    Use this option to not change the working directory to / after changing the
    root directory to newroot, i.e., inside the chroot. This option is only
    permitted when newroot is the old / directory, and therefore is mostly
    useful together with the --groups and --userspec options to retain the
    previous working directory.

The user and group name look-up performed by the --userspec and --groups
options, is done both outside and inside the chroot, with successful look-ups
inside the chroot taking precedence. If the specified user or group items are
intended to represent a numeric ID, then a name to ID resolving step is avoided
by specifying a leading ‘+’. See Disambiguating names and IDs.

Here are a few tips to help avoid common problems in using chroot. To start
with a simple example, make command refer to a statically linked binary. If you
were to use a dynamically linked executable, then you’d have to arrange to have
the shared libraries in the right place under your new root directory.

For example, if you create a statically linked ls executable, and put it in /
tmp/empty, you can run this command as root:

$ chroot /tmp/empty /ls -Rl /

Then you’ll see output like this:

/:
total 1023
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 1041745 Aug 16 11:17 ls

If you want to use a dynamically linked executable, say bash, then first run
‘ldd bash’ to see what shared objects it needs. Then, in addition to copying
the actual binary, also copy the listed files to the required positions under
your intended new root directory. Finally, if the executable requires any other
files (e.g., data, state, device files), copy them into place, too.

chroot is installed only on systems that have the chroot function, so portable
scripts should not rely on its existence.

Exit status:

125 if chroot itself fails
126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
127 if command cannot be found
the exit status of command otherwise

Footnotes

(5)

However, some systems (e.g., FreeBSD) can be configured to allow certain
regular users to use the chroot system call, and hence to run this program.
Also, on Cygwin, anyone can run the chroot command, because the underlying
function is non-privileged due to lack of support in MS-Windows. Furthermore,
the chroot command avoids the chroot system call when newroot is identical to
the old / directory for consistency with systems where this is allowed for
non-privileged users.
