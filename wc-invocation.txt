6.1 wc: Print newline, word, and byte counts

wc counts the number of bytes, characters, whitespace-separated words, and
newlines in each given file, or standard input if none are given or for a file
of ‘-’. Synopsis:

wc [option]… [file]…

wc prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was given as an
argument, it prints the file name following the counts. If more than one file
is given, wc prints a final line containing the cumulative counts, with the
file name total. The counts are printed in this order: newlines, words,
characters, bytes, maximum line length. Each count is printed right-justified
in a field with at least one space between fields so that the numbers and file
names normally line up nicely in columns. The width of the count fields varies
depending on the inputs, so you should not depend on a particular field width.
However, as a GNU extension, if only one count is printed, it is guaranteed to
be printed without leading spaces.

By default, wc prints three counts: the newline, words, and byte counts.
Options can specify that only certain counts be printed. Options do not undo
others previously given, so

wc --bytes --words

prints both the byte counts and the word counts.

With the --max-line-length option, wc prints the length of the longest line per
file, and if there is more than one file it prints the maximum (not the sum) of
those lengths. The line lengths here are measured in screen columns, according
to the current locale and assuming tab positions in every 8th column.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-c’
‘--bytes’
   
    Print only the byte counts.

‘-m’
‘--chars’
   
    Print only the character counts.

‘-w’
‘--words’
   
    Print only the word counts.

‘-l’
‘--lines’
   
    Print only the newline counts.

‘-L’
‘--max-line-length’
   
    Print only the maximum display widths. Tabs are set at every 8th column.
    Display widths of wide characters are considered. Non-printable characters
    are given 0 width.

‘--files0-from=file’
   
    Disallow processing files named on the command line, and instead process
    those named in file file; each name being terminated by a zero byte (ASCII
    NUL). This is useful when the list of file names is so long that it may
    exceed a command line length limitation. In such cases, running wc via
    xargs is undesirable because it splits the list into pieces and makes wc
    print a total for each sublist rather than for the entire list. One way to
    produce a list of ASCII NUL terminated file names is with GNU find, using
    its -print0 predicate. If file is ‘-’ then the ASCII NUL terminated file
    names are read from standard input.

    For example, to find the length of the longest line in any .c or .h file in
    the current hierarchy, do this:

    find . -name '*.[ch]' -print0 |
      wc -L --files0-from=- | tail -n1

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
