16.2 true: Do nothing, successfully

true does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning success. It can be
used as a place holder in shell scripts where a successful command is needed,
although the shell built-in command : (colon) may do the same thing faster. In
most modern shells, true is a built-in command, so when you use ‘true’ in a
script, you’re probably using the built-in command, not the one documented
here.

true honors the --help and --version options.

Note, however, that it is possible to cause true to exit with nonzero status:
with the --help or --version option, and with standard output already closed or
redirected to a file that evokes an I/O error. For example, using a
Bourne-compatible shell:

$ ./true --version >&-
./true: write error: Bad file number
$ ./true --version > /dev/full
./true: write error: No space left on device

This version of true is implemented as a C program, and is thus more secure and
faster than a shell script implementation, and may safely be used as a dummy
shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.
