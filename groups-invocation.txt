20.4 groups: Print group names a user is in

groups prints the names of the primary and any supplementary groups for each
given username, or the current process if no names are given. If more than one
name is given, the name of each user is printed before the list of that user’s
groups and the user name is separated from the group list by a colon. Synopsis:

groups [username]…

The group lists are equivalent to the output of the command ‘id -Gn’.

The only options are --help and --version. See Common options.

Primary and supplementary groups for a process are normally inherited from its
parent and are usually unchanged since login. This means that if you change the
group database after logging in, groups will not reflect your changes within
your existing login session. Running groups with a list of users causes the
user and group database to be consulted afresh, and so will give a different
result.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
