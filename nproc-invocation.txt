21.3 nproc: Print the number of available processors

Print the number of processing units available to the current process, which
may be less than the number of online processors. If this information is not
accessible, then print the number of processors installed. If the
OMP_NUM_THREADS or OMP_THREAD_LIMIT environment variables are set, then they
will determine the minimum and maximum returned value respectively. The result
is guaranteed to be greater than zero. Synopsis:

nproc [option]

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘--all’
   
    Print the number of installed processors on the system, which may be
    greater than the number online or available to the current process. The
    OMP_NUM_THREADS or OMP_THREAD_LIMIT environment variables are not honored
    in this case.

‘--ignore=number’
   
    If possible, exclude this number of processing units.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
