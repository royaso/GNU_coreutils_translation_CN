22.1 chcon: Change SELinux context of file

chcon changes the SELinux security context of the selected files. Synopses:

chcon [option]… context file…
chcon [option]… [-u user] [-r role] [-l range] [-t type] file…
chcon [option]… --reference=rfile file…

Change the SELinux security context of each file to context. With --reference,
change the security context of each file to that of rfile.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘--dereference’
   
    Do not affect symbolic links but what they refer to; this is the default.

‘-h’
‘--no-dereference’
   
    Affect the symbolic links themselves instead of any referenced file.

‘--reference=rfile’
   
    Use rfile’s security context rather than specifying a context value.

‘-R’
‘--recursive’
   
    Operate on files and directories recursively.

‘--preserve-root’
   
    Refuse to operate recursively on the root directory, /, when used together
    with the --recursive option. See Treating / specially.

‘--no-preserve-root’
   
    Do not treat the root directory, /, specially when operating recursively;
    this is the default. See Treating / specially.

‘-H’
   
    If --recursive (-R) is specified and a command line argument is a symbolic
    link to a directory, traverse it. See Traversing symlinks.

‘-L’
   
    In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory that
    is encountered. See Traversing symlinks.

‘-P’
   
    Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of -H, -L,
    or -P is specified. See Traversing symlinks.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
   
    Output a diagnostic for every file processed.

‘-u user’
‘--user=user’
   
    Set user user in the target security context.

‘-r role’
‘--role=role’
   
    Set role role in the target security context.

‘-t type’
‘--type=type’
   
    Set type type in the target security context.

‘-l range’
‘--range=range’
   
    Set range range in the target security context.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
