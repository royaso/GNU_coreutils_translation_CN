21.1.5 Setting the time

If given an argument that does not start with ‘+’, date sets the system clock
to the date and time specified by that argument (as described below). You must
have appropriate privileges to set the system clock. Note for changes to
persist across a reboot, the hardware clock may need to be updated from the
system clock, which might not happen automatically on your system.

The argument must consist entirely of digits, which have the following meaning:

‘MM’

    month

‘DD’

    day within month

‘hh’

    hour

‘mm’

    minute

‘CC’

    first two digits of year (optional)

‘YY’

    last two digits of year (optional)

‘ss’

    second (optional)

Note, the --date and --set options may not be used with an argument in the
above format. The --universal option may be used with such an argument to
indicate that the specified date and time are relative to Universal Time rather
than to the local time zone.
