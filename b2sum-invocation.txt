6.4 b2sum: Print or check BLAKE2 digests

b2sum computes a 512-bit checksum for each specified file. The same usage and
options as the md5sum command are supported. See md5sum invocation. In addition
b2sum supports the following options.

‘-l’
‘--length’
   
    Change (shorten) the default digest length. This is specified in bits and
    thus must be a multiple of 8. This option is ignored when --check is
    specified, as the length is automatically determined when checking.
