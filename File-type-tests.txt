16.3.1 File type tests

These options test for particular types of files. (Everything’s a file, but not
all files are the same!)

‘-b file’
   
    True if file exists and is a block special device.

‘-c file’
   
    True if file exists and is a character special device.

‘-d file’
   
    True if file exists and is a directory.

‘-f file’
   
    True if file exists and is a regular file.

‘-h file’
‘-L file’
   
    True if file exists and is a symbolic link. Unlike all other file-related
    tests, this test does not dereference file if it is a symbolic link.

‘-p file’
   
    True if file exists and is a named pipe.

‘-S file’
   
    True if file exists and is a socket.

‘-t fd’
   
    True if fd is a file descriptor that is associated with a terminal.
