29.4 Time zone items

A time zone item specifies an international time zone, indicated by a small set
of letters, e.g., ‘UTC’ or ‘Z’ for Coordinated Universal Time. Any included
periods are ignored. By following a non-daylight-saving time zone by the string
‘DST’ in a separate word (that is, separated by some white space), the
corresponding daylight saving time zone may be specified. Alternatively, a
non-daylight-saving time zone can be followed by a time zone correction, to add
the two values. This is normally done only for ‘UTC’; for example, ‘UTC+05:30’
is equivalent to ‘+05:30’.

Time zone items other than ‘UTC’ and ‘Z’ are obsolescent and are not
recommended, because they are ambiguous; for example, ‘EST’ has a different
meaning in Australia than in the United States. Instead, it’s better to use
unambiguous numeric time zone corrections like ‘-0500’, as described in the
previous section.

If neither a time zone item nor a time zone correction is supplied, timestamps
are interpreted using the rules of the default time zone (see Specifying time
zone rules).
