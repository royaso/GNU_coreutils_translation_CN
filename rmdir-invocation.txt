12.7 rmdir: Remove empty directories

rmdir removes empty directories. Synopsis:

rmdir [option]… directory…

If any directory argument does not refer to an existing empty directory, it is
an error.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘--ignore-fail-on-non-empty’
   
    Ignore each failure to remove a directory that is solely because the
    directory is non-empty.

‘-p’
‘--parents’
   
    Remove directory, then try to remove each component of directory. So, for
    example, ‘rmdir -p a/b/c’ is similar to ‘rmdir a/b/c a/b a’. As such, it
    fails if any of those directories turns out not to be empty. Use the
    --ignore-fail-on-non-empty option to make it so such a failure does not
    evoke a diagnostic and does not cause rmdir to exit unsuccessfully.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
   
    Give a diagnostic for each successful removal. directory is removed.

See rm invocation, for how to remove non-empty directories (recursively).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
