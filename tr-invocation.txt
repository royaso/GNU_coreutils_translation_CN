9.1 tr: Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters

Synopsis:

tr [option]… set1 [set2]

tr copies standard input to standard output, performing one of the following
operations:

  • translate, and optionally squeeze repeated characters in the result,
  • squeeze repeated characters,
  • delete characters,
  • delete characters, then squeeze repeated characters from the result.

The set1 and (if given) set2 arguments define ordered sets of characters,
referred to below as set1 and set2. These sets are the characters of the input
that tr operates on. The --complement (-c, -C) option replaces set1 with its
complement (all of the characters that are not in set1).

Currently tr fully supports only single-byte characters. Eventually it will
support multibyte characters; when it does, the -C option will cause it to
complement the set of characters, whereas -c will cause it to complement the
set of values. This distinction will matter only when some values are not
characters, and this is possible only in locales using multibyte encodings when
the input contains encoding errors.

The program accepts the --help and --version options. See Common options.
Options must precede operands.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

• Character sets:            Specifying sets of characters.
• Translating:               Changing one set of characters to another.
• Squeezing and deleting:    Removing characters.
