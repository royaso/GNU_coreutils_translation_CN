16 Conditions

This section describes commands that are primarily useful for their exit
status, rather than their output. Thus, they are often used as the condition of
shell if statements, or as the last command in a pipeline.

• false invocation:    Do nothing, unsuccessfully.
• true invocation:     Do nothing, successfully.
• test invocation:     Check file types and compare values.
• expr invocation:     Evaluate expressions.
