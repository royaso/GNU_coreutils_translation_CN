8.3 join: Join lines on a common field

join writes to standard output a line for each pair of input lines that have
identical join fields. Synopsis:

join [option]… file1 file2

Either file1 or file2 (but not both) can be ‘-’, meaning standard input. file1
and file2 should be sorted on the join fields.

$ cat file1
a 1
b 2
e 5

$ cat file2
a X
e Y
f Z

$ join file1 file2
a 1 X
e 5 Y

join’s default behavior (when no options are given):

  • the join field is the first field in each line;
  • fields in the input are separated by one or more blanks, with leading
    blanks on the line ignored;
  • fields in the output are separated by a space;
  • each output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from
    file1, then the remaining fields from file2.

• General options in join:      Options which affect general program behavior.
• Sorting files for join:       Using sort before join.
• Working with fields:          Joining on different fields.
• Paired and unpaired lines:    Controlling join’s field matching.
• Header lines:                 Working with header lines in files.
• Set operations:               Union, Intersection and Difference of files.
