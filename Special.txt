19.2.7 Special settings

‘min n’
   
    Set the minimum number of characters that will satisfy a read until the
    time value has expired, when -icanon is set.

‘time n’
   
    Set the number of tenths of a second before reads time out if the minimum
    number of characters have not been read, when -icanon is set.

‘ispeed n’
   
    Set the input speed to n.

‘ospeed n’
   
    Set the output speed to n.

‘rows n’
   
    Tell the tty kernel driver that the terminal has n rows. Non-POSIX.

‘cols n’
‘columns n’
   
    Tell the kernel that the terminal has n columns. Non-POSIX.

‘drain’
   
    Apply settings after first waiting for pending output to be transmitted.
    This is enabled by default for GNU stty. It is useful to disable this
    option in cases where the system may be in a state where serial
    transmission is not possible. For example, if the system has received the
    ‘DC3’ character with ixon (software flow control) enabled, then stty would
    block without -drain being specified. May be negated. Non-POSIX.

‘size’
   
    Print the number of rows and columns that the kernel thinks the terminal
    has. (Systems that don’t support rows and columns in the kernel typically
    use the environment variables LINES and COLUMNS instead; however, GNU stty
    does not know anything about them.) Non-POSIX.

‘line n’
   
    Use line discipline n. Non-POSIX.

‘speed’
   
    Print the terminal speed.

‘n’

    Set the input and output speeds to n. n can be one of: 0 50 75 110 134
    134.5 150 200 300 600 1200 1800 2400 4800 9600 19200 38400 exta extb. exta
    is the same as 19200; extb is the same as 38400. Many systems, including
    GNU/Linux, support higher speeds. The stty command includes support for
    speeds of 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000, 921600, 1000000,
    1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, or 4000000 where the
    system supports these. 0 hangs up the line if -clocal is set.
