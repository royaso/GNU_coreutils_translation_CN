29.8 Pure numbers in date strings

The precise interpretation of a pure decimal number depends on the context in
the date string.

If the decimal number is of the form yyyymmdd and no other calendar date item
(see Calendar date items) appears before it in the date string, then yyyy is
read as the year, mm as the month number and dd as the day of the month, for
the specified calendar date.

If the decimal number is of the form hhmm and no other time of day item appears
before it in the date string, then hh is read as the hour of the day and mm as
the minute of the hour, for the specified time of day. mm can also be omitted.

If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a number in the
date string, but no relative item, then the number overrides the year.
