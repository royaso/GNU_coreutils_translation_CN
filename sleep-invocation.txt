25.1 sleep: Delay for a specified time

sleep pauses for an amount of time specified by the sum of the values of the
command line arguments. Synopsis:

sleep number[smhd]…

Each argument is a number followed by an optional unit; the default is seconds.
The units are:

‘s’

    seconds

‘m’

    minutes

‘h’

    hours

‘d’

    days

Historical implementations of sleep have required that number be an integer,
and only accepted a single argument without a suffix. However, GNU sleep
accepts arbitrary floating point numbers. See Floating point.

The only options are --help and --version. See Common options.

Due to shell aliases and built-in sleep functions, using an unadorned sleep
interactively or in a script may get you different functionality than that
described here. Invoke it via env (i.e., env sleep …) to avoid interference
from the shell.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
