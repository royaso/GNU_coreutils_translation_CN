15.1 echo: Print a line of text

echo writes each given string to standard output, with a space between each and
a newline after the last one. Synopsis:

echo [option]… [string]…

Due to shell aliases and built-in echo functions, using an unadorned echo
interactively or in a script may get you different functionality than that
described here. Invoke it via env (i.e., env echo …) to avoid interference from
the shell.

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options. Options
must precede operands, and the normally-special argument ‘--’ has no special
meaning and is treated like any other string.

‘-n’
   
    Do not output the trailing newline.

‘-e’
   
    Enable interpretation of the following backslash-escaped characters in each
    string:

    ‘\a’

        alert (bell)

    ‘\b’

        backspace

    ‘\c’

        produce no further output

    ‘\e’

        escape

    ‘\f’

        form feed

    ‘\n’

        newline

    ‘\r’

        carriage return

    ‘\t’

        horizontal tab

    ‘\v’

        vertical tab

    ‘\\’

        backslash

    ‘\0nnn’

        the eight-bit value that is the octal number nnn (zero to three octal
        digits), if nnn is a nine-bit value, the ninth bit is ignored

    ‘\nnn’

        the eight-bit value that is the octal number nnn (one to three octal
        digits), if nnn is a nine-bit value, the ninth bit is ignored

    ‘\xhh’

        the eight-bit value that is the hexadecimal number hh (one or two
        hexadecimal digits)

‘-E’
   
    Disable interpretation of backslash escapes in each string. This is the
    default. If -e and -E are both specified, the last one given takes effect.

If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, then when echo’s first
argument is not -n it outputs option-like arguments instead of treating them as
options. For example, echo -ne hello outputs ‘-ne hello’ instead of plain
‘hello’.

POSIX does not require support for any options, and says that the behavior of
echo is implementation-defined if any string contains a backslash or if the
first argument is -n. Portable programs can use the printf command if they need
to omit trailing newlines or output control characters or backslashes. See
printf invocation.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
