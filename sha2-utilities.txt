6.7 sha2 utilities: Print or check SHA-2 digests

The commands sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum compute checksums of
various lengths (respectively 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits), collectively known
as the SHA-2 hashes. The usage and options of these commands are precisely the
same as for md5sum and sha1sum. See md5sum invocation.
