27.2.6 The Umask and Protection

If the users part of a symbolic mode is omitted, it defaults to ‘a’ (affect all
users), except that any permissions that are set in the system variable umask
are not affected. The value of umask can be set using the umask command. Its
default value varies from system to system.

Omitting the users part of a symbolic mode is generally not useful with
operations other than ‘+’. It is useful with ‘+’ because it allows you to use
umask as an easily customizable protection against giving away more permission
to files than you intended to.

As an example, if umask has the value 2, which removes write permission for
users who are not in the file’s group, then the mode:

+w

adds permission to write to the file to its owner and to other users who are in
the file’s group, but not to other users. In contrast, the mode:

a+w

ignores umask, and does give write permission for the file to all users.
