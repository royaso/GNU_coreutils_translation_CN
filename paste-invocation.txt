8.2 paste: Merge lines of files

paste writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially corresponding
lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character. Standard input is used
for a file name of ‘-’ or if no input files are given.

Synopsis:

paste [option]… [file]…

For example, with:

$ cat num2
1
2
$ cat let3
a
b
c

Take lines sequentially from each file:

$ paste num2 let3
1       a
2       b
        c

Duplicate lines from a file:

$ paste num2 let3 num2
1       a      1
2       b      2
        c

Intermix lines from stdin:

$ paste - let3 - < num2
1       a      2
        b
        c

Join consecutive lines with a space:

$ seq 4 | paste -d ' ' - -
1 2
3 4

The program accepts the following options. Also see Common options.

‘-s’
‘--serial’
   
    Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from each file.
    Using the above example data:

    $ paste -s num2 let3
    1       2
    a       b       c

‘-d delim-list’
‘--delimiters=delim-list’
   
    Consecutively use the characters in delim-list instead of TAB to separate
    merged lines. When delim-list is exhausted, start again at its beginning.
    Using the above example data:

    $ paste -d '%_' num2 let3 num2
    1%a_1
    2%b_2
    %c_

‘-z’
‘--zero-terminated’
   
    Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
    treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items with
    ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with ‘perl -0’ or ‘find
    -print0’ and ‘xargs -0’ which do the same in order to reliably handle
    arbitrary file names (even those containing blanks or other special
    characters).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
