8.3.6 Union, Intersection and Difference of files

Combine sort, uniq and join to perform the equivalent of set operations on
files:

               Command                                outcome
sort -u file1 file2                    Union of unsorted files
sort file1 file2 | uniq -d             Intersection of unsorted files
sort file1 file1 file2 | uniq          Difference of unsorted files
sort file1 file2 | uniq -u             Symmetric Difference of unsorted files
join -t'' -a1 -a2 file1 file2          Union of sorted files
join -t'' file1 file2                  Intersection of sorted files
join -t'' -v2 file1 file2              Difference of sorted files
join -t'' -v1 -v2 file1 file2          Symmetric Difference of sorted files

All examples above operate on entire lines and not on specific fields: sort
without -k and join -t'' both consider entire lines as the key.
