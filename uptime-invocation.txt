21.7 uptime: Print system uptime and load

uptime prints the current time, the system’s uptime, the number of logged-in
users and the current load average.

If an argument is specified, it is used as the file to be read to discover how
many users are logged in. If no argument is specified, a system default is used
(uptime --help indicates the default setting).

The only options are --help and --version. See Common options.

For example, here’s what it prints right now on one system I use:

$ uptime
 14:07  up   3:35,  3 users,  load average: 1.39, 1.15, 1.04

The precise method of calculation of load average varies somewhat between
systems. Some systems calculate it as the average number of runnable processes
over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes, but some systems also include processes in
the uninterruptible sleep state (that is, those processes which are waiting for
disk I/O). The Linux kernel includes uninterruptible processes.

uptime is installed only on platforms with infrastructure for obtaining the
boot time, and other packages also supply an uptime command, so portable
scripts should not rely on its existence or on the exact behavior documented
above.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
