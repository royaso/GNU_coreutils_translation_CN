First, a quote:

    Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months, are so
    complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make coherent mental
    reckoning in time all but impossible. Indeed, had some tyrannical god
    contrived to enslave our minds to time, to make it all but impossible for
    us to escape subjection to sodden routines and unpleasant surprises, he
    could hardly have done better than handing down our present system. It is
    like a set of trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
    surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands ornate
    constructions, useless particles and lengthy circumlocutions. Unlike the
    more successful patterns of language and science, which enable us to face
    experience boldly or at least level-headedly, our system of temporal
    calculation silently and persistently encourages our terror of time.

    … It is as though architects had to measure length in feet, width in meters
    and height in ells; as though basic instruction manuals demanded a
    knowledge of five different languages. It is no wonder then that we often
    look into our own immediate past or future, last Tuesday or a week from
    Sunday, with feelings of helpless confusion. …

    —Robert Grudin, Time and the Art of Living.
