19.2.6 Special characters

The special characters’ default values vary from system to system. They are set
with the syntax ‘name value’, where the names are listed below and the value
can be given either literally, in hat notation (‘^c’), or as an integer which
may start with ‘0x’ to indicate hexadecimal, ‘0’ to indicate octal, or any
other digit to indicate decimal.

For GNU stty, giving a value of ^- or undef disables that special character.
(This is incompatible with Ultrix stty, which uses a value of ‘u’ to disable a
special character. GNU stty treats a value ‘u’ like any other, namely to set
that special character to U.)

‘start’
   
    Restart the output after stopping it.

‘stop’
   
    Stop the output.

‘susp’
   
    Send a terminal stop signal.

‘dsusp’
   
    Send a terminal stop signal after flushing the input. Non-POSIX.
