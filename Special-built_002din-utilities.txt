2.12 Special built-in utilities

Some programs like nice can invoke other programs; for example, the command
‘nice cat file’ invokes the program cat by executing the command ‘cat file’.
However, special built-in utilities like exit cannot be invoked this way. For
example, the command ‘nice exit’ does not have a well-defined behavior: it may
generate an error message instead of exiting.

Here is a list of the special built-in utilities that are standardized by POSIX
1003.1-2004.

    . : break continue eval exec exit export readonly return set shift times
    trap unset

For example, because ‘.’, ‘:’, and ‘exec’ are special, the commands ‘nice .
foo.sh’, ‘nice :’, and ‘nice exec pwd’ do not work as you might expect.

Many shells extend this list. For example, Bash has several extra special
built-in utilities like history, and suspend, and with Bash the command ‘nice
suspend’ generates an error message instead of suspending.
