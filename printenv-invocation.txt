19.3 printenv: Print all or some environment variables

printenv prints environment variable values. Synopsis:

printenv [option] [variable]…

If no variables are specified, printenv prints the value of every environment
variable. Otherwise, it prints the value of each variable that is set, and
nothing for those that are not set.

The program accepts the following option. Also see Common options.

‘-0’
‘--null’
   
    Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
    newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even when
    that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

Exit status:

0 if all variables specified were found
1 if at least one specified variable was not found
2 if a write error occurred
