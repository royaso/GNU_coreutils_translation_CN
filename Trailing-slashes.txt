2.9 Trailing slashes

Some GNU programs (at least cp and mv) allow you to remove any trailing slashes
from each source argument before operating on it. The --strip-trailing-slashes
option enables this behavior.

This is useful when a source argument may have a trailing slash and specify a
symbolic link to a directory. This scenario is in fact rather common because
some shells can automatically append a trailing slash when performing file name
completion on such symbolic links. Without this option, mv, for example, (via
the system’s rename function) must interpret a trailing slash as a request to
dereference the symbolic link and so must rename the indirectly referenced
directory and not the symbolic link. Although it may seem surprising that such
behavior be the default, it is required by POSIX and is consistent with other
parts of that standard.
