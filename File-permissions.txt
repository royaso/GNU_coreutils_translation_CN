27 File permissions

Each file has a set of file mode bits that control the kinds of access that
users have to that file. They can be represented either in symbolic form or as
an octal number.

• Mode Structure:                 Structure of file mode bits.
• Symbolic Modes:                 Mnemonic representation of file mode bits.
• Numeric Modes:                  File mode bits as octal numbers.
• Operator Numeric Modes:         ANDing, ORing, and setting modes octally.
• Directory Setuid and Setgid:    Set-user-ID and set-group-ID on directories.
