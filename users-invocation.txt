20.5 users: Print login names of users currently logged in

users prints on a single line a blank-separated list of user names of users
currently logged in to the current host. Each user name corresponds to a login
session, so if a user has more than one login session, that user’s name will
appear the same number of times in the output. Synopsis:

users [file]

With no file argument, users extracts its information from a system-maintained
file (often /var/run/utmp or /etc/utmp). If a file argument is given, users
uses that file instead. A common choice is /var/log/wtmp.

The only options are --help and --version. See Common options.

The users command is installed only on platforms with the POSIX <utmpx.h>
include file or equivalent, so portable scripts should not rely on its
existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
