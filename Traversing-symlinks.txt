2.10 Traversing symlinks

The following options modify how chown and chgrp traverse a hierarchy when the
--recursive (-R) option is also specified. If more than one of the following
options is specified, only the final one takes effect. These options specify
whether processing a symbolic link to a directory entails operating on just the
symbolic link or on all files in the hierarchy rooted at that directory.

These options are independent of --dereference and --no-dereference (-h), which
control whether to modify a symlink or its referent.

‘-H’
   
    If --recursive (-R) is specified and a command line argument is a symbolic
    link to a directory, traverse it.

‘-L’
   
    In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory that
    is encountered.

‘-P’
   
    Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of -H, -L,
    or -P is specified.
