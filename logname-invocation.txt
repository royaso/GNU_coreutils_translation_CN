20.2 logname: Print current login name

logname prints the calling user’s name, as found in a system-maintained file
(often /var/run/utmp or /etc/utmp), and exits with a status of 0. If there is
no entry for the calling process, logname prints an error message and exits
with a status of 1.

The only options are --help and --version. See Common options.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
