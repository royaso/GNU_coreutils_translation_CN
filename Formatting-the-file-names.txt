10.1.7 Formatting the file names

These options change how file names themselves are printed.

‘-b’
‘--escape’
‘--quoting-style=escape’
   
    Quote nongraphic characters in file names using alphabetic and octal
    backslash sequences like those used in C.

‘-N’
‘--literal’
‘--quoting-style=literal’
   
    Do not quote file names. However, with ls nongraphic characters are still
    printed as question marks if the output is a terminal and you do not
    specify the --show-control-chars option.

‘-q’
‘--hide-control-chars’
   
    Print question marks instead of nongraphic characters in file names. This
    is the default if the output is a terminal and the program is ls.

‘-Q’
‘--quote-name’
‘--quoting-style=c’
   
    Enclose file names in double quotes and quote nongraphic characters as in
    C.

‘--quoting-style=word’
   
    Use style word to quote file names and other strings that may contain
    arbitrary characters. The word should be one of the following:

    ‘literal’

        Output strings as-is; this is the same as the -N or --literal option.

    ‘shell’

        Quote strings for the shell if they contain shell metacharacters or
        would cause ambiguous output. The quoting is suitable for
        POSIX-compatible shells like bash, but it does not always work for
        incompatible shells like csh.

    ‘shell-always’

        Quote strings for the shell, even if they would normally not require
        quoting.

    ‘shell-escape’

        Like ‘shell’, but also quoting non-printable characters using the POSIX
        proposed ‘$''’ syntax suitable for most shells.

    ‘shell-escape-always’

        Like ‘shell-escape’, but quote strings even if they would normally not
        require quoting.

    ‘c’

        Quote strings as for C character string literals, including the
        surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the -Q or
        --quote-name option.

    ‘escape’

        Quote strings as for C character string literals, except omit the
        surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the -b or
        --escape option.

    ‘clocale’

        Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use
        surrounding quotation marks appropriate for the locale.

    ‘locale’

        Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use
        surrounding quotation marks appropriate for the locale, and quote 'like
        this' instead of "like this" in the default C locale. This looks nicer
        on many displays.

    You can specify the default value of the --quoting-style option with the
    environment variable QUOTING_STYLE. If that environment variable is not
    set, the default value is ‘shell-escape’ when the output is a terminal, and
    ‘literal’ otherwise.

‘--show-control-chars’
   
    Print nongraphic characters as-is in file names. This is the default unless
    the output is a terminal and the program is ls.
